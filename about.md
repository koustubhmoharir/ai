This blog tracks my progress exploring the field of Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on Natural Language Processing. I have followed this field from a distance for several years with a deep skepticism. Though I remain skeptical, I do see that it has produced a lot of useful technology and I want to understand how and why this technology works.

The posts here will cover papers I read, my thoughts about the content of those papers, and any insights I wish to document.
